								The role of attachment in explaining conflict resolution tactics used by adolescents with parents 
							</h3>
							<p class="card-text">
								Adolescence is known as a period of greater conflicts in the parent-child relationship. Adolescents have been recognised to have three key methods for resolving disputes: avoidance, pro-social and aggressive. Previous research has placed emphasis on the role of attachment in determining what conflict resolution tactics are implemented during the years of adolescence, while at the same time finding gender and age differences. The aim of the current research was to understand if a dichotic measurement of attachment, ranging from secure to insecure, could predict the use of specific conflict resolution tactics while controlling for age and gender. A cross sectional design with three multiple regressions were used. The predictor variable was attachment, while the outcome variables were conflict resolution tactics. Attachment was found to a have a significant negative relationship with the use of aggressive conflict resolution tactics, with age explaining some unexplained variance. There were also significant correlations between age and the use of aggressive tactics, age and attachment and lastly age and aggressive conflict resolution tactics while controlling for attachment. These findings are explained in relation to real world implication of the importance of attachment to parents.
